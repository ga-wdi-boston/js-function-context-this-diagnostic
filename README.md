You may use **any resource** other than each other to complete this diagnostic.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
your responses are correct.

**Note**: For this diagnostic, `grunt nag` will complain about example code we
have provided for the questions. You are not required to fix this warnings. Only
fix warnings that occur on lines you have written for your response.
